# Three-dimensional-eye-rotations
Decompose the three dimensional rotations of the eye taking into account Listings and Donder's law. Visulalise the final rotational vectors in the Listings 
plane. 

Simulate the intial and final positions of the eye after executing the rotation made to follow the stimulus presented on a screen.

LIST OF FILES

1. main.m - Execute the trials
2. screen.m - Create the scene / structure and properties of the screen.
3. mesh.m - Create and display the screen with mesh points
4. rotation.m - Calulate the angle of rotation of the eyes made to follow the stimulus point and the rotation vector to describe the movement.
5. root2d. m - Find the roots of the function (system of equations to convert rotation vectors to Fick's angles)
6. visualangle.m -  Calculate the visual angle for the rotation executed in each trial.
7. eyesim.m - Simulate the initial and final position of the eye movements
8. rotpt.m - Rotate an input point by the angles in x,y and z directions ccording to Fick's Rotation sequence.
